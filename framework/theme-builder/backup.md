# Theme Builder

Welcome to the **Theme Builder** documentation! This guide will walk you through how to create and manage different types of templates—**Header**, **Footer**, **Archive**, and **Single**—using the Theme Builder feature in the **CodexShaper Framework**.

## Overview

The **Theme Builder** allows you to create custom layouts for various sections of your WordPress site. Instead of relying on default theme templates, you can design and assign your own:

- **Headers** for branding and navigation.
- **Footers** for contact information, credits, or widgets.
- **Archives** for blog listings, category pages, or search results.
- **Single** posts or pages, for unique content layouts.

## Types of Templates

### Header
- **Purpose**: The Header template typically contains your site’s logo, navigation menu, and other important links.
- **Usage**: Create multiple header designs for different pages or conditions (e.g., one for your homepage, another for landing pages).

### Footer
- **Purpose**: The Footer template usually includes site credits, contact information, social media links, or any widgets you want to display at the bottom of your site.
- **Usage**: You can have multiple footers for different pages or conditions, just like headers.

### Archive
- **Purpose**: Archive templates handle the layout for listings such as blog posts, categories, tags, or search results.
- **Usage**: Customize how your post listings appear, including featured images, excerpt lengths, and meta data (author, date, categories, etc.).

### Single
- **Purpose**: Single templates are used for individual posts or pages. This is where you design the content layout for each specific post type.
- **Usage**: Create a unique single template for blog posts, portfolio items, or any custom post type you have.

## Setting Display Conditions

In the **Theme Builder Meta Box**, you’ll see an option for **Display Location**:

- **Specific Pages/Posts**: Assign the template to a particular page or post.
- **Entire Website**: If you want the template to apply site-wide.
- **Categories/Tags**: For Archive templates, you can choose specific categories or tags to apply the layout.
- **Custom Post Types**: If you have additional post types, you can target those as well.

Make sure to carefully set these conditions to ensure your new template appears where you expect.
